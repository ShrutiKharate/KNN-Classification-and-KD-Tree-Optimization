# KNN-Classification-and-KD-Tree-Optimization
This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to video game sales data to **predict game genre**. We used **scaling, encoding, and a KD-Tree** for efficient search. The goal was to **tune and evaluate** the model while analyzing the mechanics, efficiency, and limitations of this distance-based algorithm.
